SPYN is an amazing infrastructure platform for developing, maintaining and deploying complete Odoo based solutions. For example, if you have built a vertical solution for a furniture-stores, or any such specialised businesses, with plenty of custom modules, SPYN lets you setup-once, and deploy a zillion times, with 0-manual-effort.

SPYN offers ultra-modern private-cloud features like auto-healing, redundancy, fail-safety, load-balancing, horizontal-scaling, automated rollback and rollout, and more.

SPYN can be accessed via a REST API. We hope users utilise it to develop their own clients to manage their Odoo deployments.

`sypncli` is a command-line interface to manage your Odoo installations on SPYN.  It's Opensource and free. We welcome your PRs, feedback and issue-reports.
